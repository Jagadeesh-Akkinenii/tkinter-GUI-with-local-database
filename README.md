# tkinter-GUI-with-local-database
This GUI checks username and password then redirects to a window where you can do changes to your local database.
The process starts from outerwindow.py

Hey, I created this small code to store all my favourite anime
and their links in a single place.

In this repository you will find 3 files excluding this file.
The files are,
1. outerwindow.py
2. background.py
3. innerwindow.py

## outerwindow.py
-In the outerwindow.py file you can set your username and password,
 it should be in the line 31 where you will be able to see "test"
 the first one is username and the second is password.

-Incase you are finding difficulty in finding it you should check 
 the "def check_command()" function and I am sure you will be able
 to understand it.

## background.py
-In this all the SQL content is executed. I used SQLite to create a
 local database and connected it to innerwindow.py. This code contains
 all the basic functions of SQL.

## innerwindow.py
-This is the part where all the functioning is taking place i.e, adding
 new entry, deleting, updating, viewing, closing ,etc.

-I am planning to upgrade this code by adding better UI design and I
 am also going to add register option so that multiple accounts can
 be created and you won't have to manually change the code everytime!
