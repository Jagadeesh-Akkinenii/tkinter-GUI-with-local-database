-Hey, I created this small code to store all my favourite anime
 and their links in a single place.

-In the outerwindow.py file you can set your username and password,
 it should be in the line 31 where you will be able to see "test"
 the first one is username and the second is password.

-Incase you are finding difficulty in finding it you should check 
 the "def check_command()" function and I am sure you will be able
 to understand it.

-I am planning to upgrade this code by adding better UI design and I
 am also going to add register option so that multiple accounts can
 be created and you won't have to manually change the code everytime!
